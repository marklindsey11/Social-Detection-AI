# Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step technical summary for this AI-generated post detector system that includes computer vision for detecting objects in images and videos as   well as posts, comments and SMS text messages:

    Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of posts, comments and SMS text messages from different social media platforms.

    Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to remove any irrelevant or duplicate posts or messages, and standardize formatting or grammatical errors.

    Text Preprocessing: Tokenize the text data and remove stop words to prepare it for further analysis.

    Image and Video Processing: Use computer vision techniques to detect objects in images and videos.

    Machine Learning Algorithm: Train a machine learning algorithm, deep learning neural network, using the preprocessed data.

    Evaluation Metrics: Use evaluation metrics, precision and recall, to measure the accuracy of the algorithm.

    Performance Improvements: Refine the machine learning algorithm based on the evaluation results to improve performance.

    Integration: Integrate the algorithm into the social media platform's existing infrastructure to monitor posts, comments, and SMS text messages in real-time.

    Alert and Flagging Mechanism: Implement an alert and flagging mechanism to notify administrators of potentially harmful or inappropriate content
    User Feedback and Improvement: We use "user feedback" to continually improve the algorithm and reduce false positives or false negatives.

    This comprehensive system involves collecting and preprocessing data, using computer vision techniques for image and video processing, training a machine learning algorithm, evaluating and improving performance, and integrating the algorithm into the social media platform's infrastructure with an alert and flagging mechanism for any synthetic posts or content generated by artificial
