Here are the Python libraries and GitHub repositories that are used to collect large datasets to train the model from various social media platforms:

    Tweepy: A Python library for accessing the Twitter API to collect tweets, retweets, and other data.

    Instagram-API-python: A Python wrapper for the Instagram private API that allows you to scrape user data, posts, and stories.

    PRAW: A Python wrapper for the Reddit API that allows you to scrape posts, comments, and other data.

    Facebook-Scraper: A Python library for scraping public Facebook pages, posts, and comments.

    LinkedIn-Scraper: A Python library for scraping public LinkedIn profiles and data.

    Telethon: A Python library for accessing the Telegram API to collect messages and other data.

    VK-API: A Python library for accessing the VK (Vkontakte) API to collect user data, posts, and other data.

    Social Media APIs: A GitHub repository that contains Python code for accessing various social media APIs, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more.
